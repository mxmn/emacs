* Emacs Basic Commands and Functionality
Things that I tend to forget after a while, and which are good to revisit from time to time.

*Starting Emacs options*
|-------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~-nw~ | terminal mode                                                    |
| ~-q~  | do not load an init file                                         |
| ~-Q~  | do not load any startup files (site-wide; X resorces, your init) |

*Keys*
|------+---------------------------|
| =C-= | Control                   |
| =M-= | Meta (Alt)                |
| =S-= | Shift                     |
| =s-= | Super                     |
| =H-= | Hyper                     |
| =A-= | Alt (redundant; not used) |

*Universal Arguments* Worth learning to use them (including digit and
negative arguments). Note the flexebility to maintain your tempo.
|----------------------------------+-------------------------------------|
| =C-u=                            | digit argument                    4 |
| =C-u C-u=                        | digit argument 16                   |
| =C-u= =...=                      | digit argument $4^n$                |
| =M-0= or =C-0= to =M-9= or =C-9= | digit argument 0 to 9               |
| =C--= or =M--= or =C-M--=        | negative argument                   |

*Elisp Code*
|-------------------+-----------------|
| =M-x eval buffer= | evaluate buffer |
| =M-x eval-region= | evaluate region |

*Package Management*

Add the ~ELPA~ (official), and ~Melpa~ and ~Marmelade~ (unofficial)
package repositories to your init file. The inofficial sites might go
down. Check the Emacs Wiki if problems appear.

*The Info Manual*

It's immensly useful to get information fast and convenient. It's
worth knowing the basic keybindings:
|-------------+--------------------------------------|
| =[= and =]= | Previous / next node                 |
| =l= and =r= | Go back / forward in history         |
| =p= and =n= | Previous / next sibling mode         |
| =u=         | Goes up one level                    |
| =SPC=       | Scroll one screen at a time          |
| =TAB=       | Cycles through links                 |
| =RET=       | Opens link                           |
| =m=         | Prompts for a menu item name to open |

*Emacs Help*
|---------+--------------------------------------|
| =C-a=   | Apropos command                      |
| =C-h m= | Info on major/minor mode (check it!) |
| =C-h f= | Info on function                     |
| =C-h v= | Info on variable                     |
| =C-h k= | Info on keybding                     |


* To be sorted

*** Working with Log Files
Emacs has an /auto compression mode/ that automatically de-compresses
and re-compresses files when you open and save them. Combined with
=M-x dired= one can browse compressed archives like directories.

The auto-revert mode can be very useful as well to monitor changing files.
|-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| =C-x C-r=                   | Open file in read-only mode                       |
| =C-x C-q=                   | Toggle read-only mode                             |
| =M-x flush-lines=           | Flush lines matching a pattern                    |
| =M-x keep-lines=            | Keep only lines matching a pattern                |
| =M-s o=                     | List lines matching a pattern                     |
| =M-s h p=                   | Highlight a phrase                                |
| =M-s h r=                   | Highlight regular expression                      |
| =M-s h .=                   | Highlight symbol at the point                     |
| =M-s h u=                   | Removes highlighting under point                  |
| =M-x auto-revert-mode=      | Reverts buffer when file changes                  |
| =M-x auto-revert-tail-mode= | Appends changes and follows; similar to =tail -f= |

*** TRAMP: Remote File Editing
First, change the default protocol =tramp-default-method= to use
=ssh=. The TRAMP connections follow the syntax:
: /ssh:[user@]hostname[#port]:path
where =user= and =port= are optional, and tramp uses the =.ssh/config=
configuration as well.

One can start shells on the remote host and execute a lot of other commands.

Add as well the =sudo= command to the init file to switch to the sudo
mode when editing a file.
