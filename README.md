# emacs
Just my Emacs configuration files.

Modular structure with just a few files. 
- i-menu friendly with the ";;;;" delimeter
- personal setup (identity, local paths) is in a file outside of this public repository
- init.el - main initialization file, handles the early interface setup and packages
- emacs_abc.el - basic setup, including window configuration, helm, magit, custom functions, etc.
- emacs_org.el - org setup
- emacs_idl.el - IDL/IDLWave customization
- emacs_pyconda.el - python mode customization
- emacs_latex.el - latex mode customization
